and the concept of closure is also great.

* concept of left sweep and right sweep is super helpful sometime. it was great in  closure question and histogram
problem

* whenever in quesitions where we have to find the max then searching in decreasing order helps because
whenever the solutions is found we terminate we can teminate else in increasing order we hava continue searching
till max possible answer
